                <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                <p>The following are common exercises that we
                    encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.
                <dl>

                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and
                        endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your
                        hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then
                        jump up from a squatted position. </dd>

                    <dt>Plank</dt>
                    <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up
                        position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you
                        can. </dd>

                    <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                    <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the
                        floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as
                        quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
